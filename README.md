This is my website ðŸ˜Š

I started from an HTML5 UP template to get most of the html code quickly. </br>
Animations are in Javascript. I was inspired by the design of some existing websites.</br>

On this website, you will discover :

- who I am
- what I have to offer
- my experiences
- my skills (soft/hard)
- a glimpse of data projects I've been working on
- a contact form, with my contact details

Feel free to check it !
